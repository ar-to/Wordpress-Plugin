#WordPress Plugin development
##Custom plugin

This project will be developed over time to make a full functional WordPress plugin.

## Plugins Summary
### First Plugin
Sample boilerplate to start a plugin via class or plain functions.

### Second Plugin
Sample plugin to modify admin area, send ajax request with/without user permissions and modify the options table.

On activation:
- you will get two alerts. One for simple text and another after an ajax call to wordpress api
- you will see text and buttons at the footer
- setting the description changes it in the options table

This plugin does not implement a plugin setting page. Another plugin will be used for this. 

### Basic Plugin
